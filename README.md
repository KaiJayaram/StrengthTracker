# Strength Tracker Android Mobile app
This App was implemented in Android studio for android mobile phones.

# Create Workout Templates
  The app allows users to create quick access workout templates that have designed set/rep schemes
  and can be quickly logged and used along with the workout to record weight performed data.
# View Previouse Workouts
  From the calander tab users can see all workouts they have done listed on the date they were completed.
  They can click on these previous workouts to view what they did on this day or make edits.
# Schedule Future Workouts
  From the calander tab users can set up a schedule to let them know what workout templates they should be completing
  on future days. This can be done in multiple ways. The first is by simply clicking on the date you wish to plan a workout
  and adding a future workout template to that date. The second is by clicking the plan workouts option at the bottom of the 
  screen. This button allows the user to make a schedule based off a particular # of days. So if you have a 7 day rotation where
  you workout every other day you can put the exact workouts you wish to do on each day, including rest days, and the app will 
  automatically add this rotation continuesly throughout the calander as planned days. This can be easily removed with the 
  clear scheduled workouts button
# Track Progress
  The coolest feature of the app and its main purpose is the progress tab. In here you will find a dynamic graph that
  was implemented using the open source graphview library. These graphs collect data from your workouts and allow you
  to view preset axis that help you to understand your improvement. The graphs include data like estimated one rep max
  and volume progress in specific lifts or overall over time.
